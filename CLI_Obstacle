# Reflection
# This was a very helpful exercise in that I got to practise and get more comfortable with the command line.  I had to edit my history because it was very long.  I was confused in how to edit a gist so that also was fun to figure out.
This was definitely one of the exercises I wanted to work on.  And I'm glad I got to see many ways to move around the directories.
